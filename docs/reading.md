[2024 Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Has Thoughts on AI Agents, Automation, and The Future of Your Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS3xYlVc8i4)
**Marc Benioff** is the CEO and co-founder of Salesforce. Benioff joins Big Technology Podcast for a wide ranging discussion on AI agents, automation, and the future of labor. In this episode, we discuss his vision for AI agents and how they'll transform the way companies interact with customers. Tune in to hear why Benioff believes the future isn't about personal AI assistants, but rather company-specific agents built on robust data systems that can take effective action on our behalf. We also cover his thoughts on Microsoft's Copilot, Klarna's provocative statements about abandoning traditional software, whether he'll sell Time Magazine, and what happened with Elon's purchase of Twitter. Hit play for an illuminating conversation about the future of work, enterprise software, and how AI might create a new era of business productivity.

[2024 WTF is Artificial Intelligence Really? | Yann LeCun x Nikhil Kamath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAgHUDhaTU0)
A lot of us have heard conjectures around A.I., edge cases of the positive and negative side of A.I., and a lot of us are trying to predict what’s next. Most of my understanding of A.I. comes only from viewing what is apparent today.. reinforcement learning spaces like chat gpt becoming a go-to.
In this episode of People by WTF, we uncover the basics of this mystery of artificial intelligence with one of the founding fathers of A.I., Yann LeCun. We spoke about popular AI myths and broke down complex concepts that can perhaps help the next generation of builders build in this space.
To learn more about Machine Learning, we’ve collated some sources for your benefit and growth in this industry.

[2024 Andrew Ng Explores The Rise Of AI Agents And Agentic Reasoning | BUILD 2024 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrRD7r7y7NY)
In recent years, the spotlight in AI has primarily been on large language models (LLMs) and emerging large multi-modal models (LMMs). Now, building on these tools, a new paradigm is emerging with the rise of AI agents and agentic reasoning, which are proving to be both cost-effective and powerful for building numerous new applications. As AI continues to evolve, data across all industries—particularly unstructured data such as text, images, video, and audio—is becoming more critical than ever. In this keynote session from BUILD 2024, Andrews Ng, Founder and Executive Chairman of Landing AI, explores the rise of AI, agents, and the growing role of unstructured data. He also discusses how this convergence will shape automation and application building across industries.

[2024 November: A new golden age of discovery](https://deepmind.google/public-policy/ai-for-science/)
In this essay, we take a tour of how AI is transforming scientific disciplines from genomics to computer science to weather forecasting. Some scientists are training their own AI models, while others are fine-tuning existing AI models, or using these models’ predictions to accelerate their research. Scientists are using AI as a scientific instrument to help tackle important problems, such as designing proteins that bind more tightly to disease targets, but are also gradually transforming how science itself is practised.

[Agent AI: Surveying the Horizons of Multimodal Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03568)
Multi-modal AI systems will likely become a ubiquitous presence in our everyday lives. A promising approach to making these systems more interactive is to embody them as agents within physical and virtual environments. At present, systems leverage existing foundation models as the basic building blocks for the creation of embodied agents. Embedding agents within such environments facilitates the ability of models to process and interpret visual and contextual data, which is critical for the creation of more sophisticated and context-aware AI systems. For example, a system that can perceive user actions, human behavior, environmental objects, audio expressions, and the collective sentiment of a scene can be used to inform and direct agent responses within the given environment. To accelerate research on agent-based multimodal intelligence, we define "Agent AI" as a class of interactive systems that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other environmentally-grounded data, and can produce meaningful embodied actions. In particular, we explore systems that aim to improve agents based on next-embodied action prediction by incorporating external knowledge, multi-sensory inputs, and human feedback. We argue that by developing agentic AI systems in grounded environments, one can also mitigate the hallucinations of large foundation models and their tendency to generate environmentally incorrect outputs. The emerging field of Agent AI subsumes the broader embodied and agentic aspects of multimodal interactions. Beyond agents acting and interacting in the physical world, we envision a future where people can easily create any virtual reality or simulated scene and interact with agents embodied within the virtual environment.

[Empowering biomedical discovery with AI agents](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(24)01070-5.pdf)
We envision ‘‘AI scientists’’ as systems capable of skeptical learning and reasoning that empower biomedical
research through collaborative agents that integrate AI models and biomedical tools with experimental platforms. Rather than taking humans out of the discovery process, biomedical AI agents combine human creativity and expertise with AI’s ability to analyze large datasets, navigate hypothesis spaces, and execute
repetitive tasks. AI agents are poised to be proficient in various tasks, planning discovery workflows and performing self-assessment to identify and mitigate gaps in their knowledge. These agents use large language
models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning
tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas
ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits
to developing new therapies
